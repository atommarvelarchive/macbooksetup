# General mac usage tips
Here is a detailed list of keyboard shortcuts on mac:

Here are some pieces to get you started:

* (⌘) represents the command key which is to the left and right of the space bar
* (⌥) represents the option key which is next to both of the command keys (it just says option on it)
* (⌘ + X/C/V/Z) is how you cut/copy/paste/undo in most apps
* (⌘ + TAB) to switch between apps like (alt+tab) on windows
* (⌘ + \`) to switch between multiple instances of the same app
    * \` is the key to the left of 1
    * For example: if you had multiple chrome windows open, that is how you switch between them.
* Using 3 fingers to swipe up on the trackpad shows you all your current windows on your desktop. 
    * You can then click on a window to bring it into focus
    * You can also swipe down with 3 fingers to go back to the previous view that you came from
    * This feature is called 'Mission Control' in case you need to Google questions
* (⌘ + spacebar) opens spotlight
   * It's like the equvalent of using the search in the start menu in windows
   * You can type the names of applications in this to easily find and open them.
   * You can also see a list of apps by pressing the f4 button (it has a grid icon on it)
* The App called [Finder](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201732) is the equvalient to windows file explorer

A terminal that is more fully featured than the one that comes with MacOS by default.

Just a quality of life thing. I also assume that this is the terminal you are using.

# nvm
### What
It stands for *Node* *Version* *Manager*! [The github repo is here.](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
### Why
It simplifies installing and updating (in the future) node.js. We use this instead of just trying to install node directly.
### How
Just run this line in iTerm2. This downloads a script then executes it which takes care of installation.
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.6/install.sh | bash
```
Next run this to make sure that nvm is working:
```
source ~/.zshrc # This loads the nvm shortcut
nvm --help # This should show you a list of nvm commands you can run
```
